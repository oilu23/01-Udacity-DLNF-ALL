    "# Introducing NumPy\n",
    "Python is convenient, but it can also be slow. However, it does allow you to access libraries that execute faster code written in languages like C. NumPy is one such library: it provides fast alternatives to math operations in Python and is designed to work efficiently with groups of numbers - like matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a large library and we are only going to scratch the surface of it here. If you plan on doing much math with Python, you should definitely spend some time exploring its documentation to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Importing NumPy\n",

    "\n",
    "These types are important because every object you make (vectors, matrices, tensors) eventually stores scalars. And when you create a NumPy array, you can specify the type - but every item in the array must have the same type. In this regard, NumPy arrays are more like C arrays than Python lists.\n",
